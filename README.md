# Introduction
This is my undergraduate project to obtain the degree in Mechatronic engineering at `Universidad Cat√≥lica Boliviana "San Pablo"` college.
## Execute server
To wake up server it is first necessary to download dependencies using `npm`:
```
npm install
```
### There are two excecuting methods. One for development and other for production each of them are available in NPM script form.
- Develpment Initialization command
```
npm run devel-env
```
- Normal Initialization command
```
npm start
```
## Build (compilation)
To generate a production ready build run the `Build command`
```
npm run build
```
# Features

Basic CRUD Operations will be implemented soon
# Logging system

- __error():__
- __debug():__
## Debug levels
- __Debug Level 0:__ No debug
