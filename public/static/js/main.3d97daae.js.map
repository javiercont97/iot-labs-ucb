For\n\t * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {state => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n\t * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n\t * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n\t * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n\t * the following example (we'll use the\n\t * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * function App() {\n\t *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <div>\n\t *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n\t *         {state => (\n\t *           // ...\n\t *         )}\n\t *       </Transition>\n\t *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n\t *         Click to Enter\n\t *       </button>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   );\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n\t * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n\t * to `'entered'`.\n\t *\n\t * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n\t * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t */\n\t\n\texports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\t\n\tvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n\t  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\t\n\t  function Transition(props, context) {\n\t    var _this;\n\t\n\t    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n\t    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\t\n\t    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ? props.enter : props.appear;\n\t    var initialStatus;\n\t    _this.appearStatus = null;\n\t\n\t    if (props.in) {\n\t      if (appear) {\n\t        initialStatus = EXITED;\n\t        _this.appearStatus = ENTERING;\n\t      } else {\n\t        initialStatus = ENTERED;\n\t      }\n\t    } else {\n\t      if (props.unmountOnExit || props.mountOnEnter) {\n\t        initialStatus = UNMOUNTED;\n\t      } else {\n\t        initialStatus = EXITED;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    _this.state = {\n\t      status: initialStatus\n\t    };\n\t    _this.nextCallback = null;\n\t    return _this;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  Transition.getDerivedStateFromProps = function getDerivedStateFromProps(_ref, prevState) {\n\t    var nextIn = _ref.in;\n\t\n\t    if (nextIn && prevState.status === UNMOUNTED) {\n\t      return {\n\t        status: EXITED\n\t      };\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    return null;\n\t  } // getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps) {\n\t  //   let nextStatus = null\n\t  //   if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n\t  //     const { status } = this.state\n\t  //     if (this.props.in) {\n\t  //       if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n\t  //         nextStatus = ENTERING\n\t  //       }\n\t  //     } else {\n\t  //       if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n\t  //         nextStatus = EXITING\n\t  //       }\n\t  //     }\n\t  //   }\n\t  //   return { nextStatus }\n\t  // }\n\t  ;\n\t\n\t  var _proto = Transition.prototype;\n\t\n\t  _proto.componentDidMount = function componentDidMount() {\n\t    this.updateStatus(true, this.appearStatus);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  _proto.componentDidUpdate = function componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n\t    var nextStatus = null;\n\t\n\t    if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n\t      var status = this.state.status;\n\t\n\t      if (this.props.in) {\n\t        if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n\t          nextStatus = ENTERING;\n\t        }\n\t      } else {\n\t        if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n\t          nextStatus = EXITING;\n\t        }\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    this.updateStatus(false, nextStatus);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  _proto.componentWillUnmount = function componentWillUnmount() {\n\t    this.cancelNextCallback();\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  _proto.getTimeouts = function getTimeouts() {\n\t    var timeout = this.props.timeout;\n\t    var exit, enter, appear;\n\t    exit = enter = appear = timeout;\n\t\n\t    if (timeout != null && typeof timeout !== 'number') {\n\t      exit = timeout.exit;\n\t      enter = timeout.enter; // TODO: remove fallback for next major\n\t\n\t      appear = timeout.appear !== undefined ? timeout.appear : enter;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    return {\n\t      exit: exit,\n\t      enter: enter,\n\t      appear: appear\n\t    };\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  _proto.updateStatus = function updateStatus(mounting, nextStatus) {\n\t    if (mounting === void 0) {\n\t      mounting = false;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (nextStatus !== null) {\n\t      // nextStatus will always be ENTERING or EXITING.\n\t      this.cancelNextCallback();\n\t\n\t      if (nextStatus === ENTERING) {\n\t        this.performEnter(mounting);\n\t      } else {\n\t        this.performExit();\n\t      }\n\t    } else if (this.props.unmountOnExit && this.state.status === EXITED) {\n\t      this.setState({\n\t        status: UNMOUNTED\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  _proto.performEnter = function performEnter(mounting) {\n\t    var _this2 = this;\n\t\n\t    var enter = this.props.enter;\n\t    var appearing = this.context ? this.context.isMounting : mounting;\n\t\n\t    var _ref2 = this.props.nodeRef ?

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ? props.enter : props.appear;\n    var initialStatus;\n    _this.appearStatus = null;\n\n    if (props.in) {\n      if (appear) {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n        _this.appearStatus = ENTERING;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = ENTERED;\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (props.unmountOnExit || props.mountOnEnter) {\n        initialStatus = UNMOUNTED;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n      }\n    }\n\n    _this.state = {\n      status: initialStatus\n    };\n    _this.nextCallback = null;\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  Transition.getDerivedStateFromProps = function getDerivedStateFromProps(_ref, prevState) {\n    var nextIn = _ref.in;\n\n    if (nextIn && prevState.status === UNMOUNTED) {\n      return {\n        status: EXITED\n      };\n    }\n\n    return null;\n  } // getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps) {\n  //   let nextStatus = null\n  //   if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n  //     const { status } = this.state\n  //     if (this.props.in) {\n  //       if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = ENTERING\n  //       }\n  //     } else {\n  //       if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = EXITING\n  //       }\n  //     }\n  //   }\n  //   return { nextStatus }\n  // }\n  ;\n\n  var _proto = Transition.prototype;\n\n  _proto.componentDidMount = function componentDidMount() {\n    this.updateStatus(true, this.appearStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentDidUpdate = function componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    var nextStatus = null;\n\n    if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n      var status = this.state.status;\n\n      if (this.props.in) {\n        if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = ENTERING;\n        }\n      } else {\n        if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = EXITING;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    this.updateStatus(false, nextStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentWillUnmount = function componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.cancelNextCallback();\n  };\n\n  _proto.getTimeouts = function getTimeouts() {\n    var timeout = this.props.timeout;\n    var exit, enter, appear;\n    exit = enter = appear = timeout;\n\n    if (timeout != null && typeof timeout !== 'number') {\n      exit = timeout.exit;\n      enter = timeout.enter; // TODO: remove fallback for next major\n\n      appear = timeout.appear !== undefined ? timeout.appear : enter;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      exit: exit,\n      enter: enter,\n      appear: appear\n    };\n  };\n\n  _proto.updateStatus = function updateStatus(mounting, nextStatus) {\n    if (mounting === void 0) {\n      mounting = false;\n    }\n\n    if (nextStatus !== null) {\n      // nextStatus will always be ENTERING or EXITING.\n      this.cancelNextCallback();\n\n      if (nextStatus === ENTERING) {\n        this.performEnter(mounting);\n      } else {\n        this.performExit();\n      }\n    } else if (this.props.unmountOnExit && this.state.status === EXITED) {\n      this.setState({\n        status: UNMOUNTED\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  _proto.performEnter = function performEnter(mounting) {\n    var _this2 = this;\n\n    var enter = this.props.enter;\n    var appearing = this.context ? this.context.isMounting : mounting;\n\n    var _ref2 = this.props.nodeRef ?

Este es un bug conocido de llvm. La forma de evitarlo es creando el proyecto en una ruta que no tenga espacios.\n                                            Se espera que este problema se solucione en futuras versiones de Emscripten.
