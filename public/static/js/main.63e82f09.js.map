Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n\t * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n\t * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n\t * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n\t * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n\t * name of the component).\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n\t * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n\t * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {state => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n\t * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n\t * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n\t * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ? props.enter : props.appear;\n    var initialStatus;\n    _this.appearStatus = null;\n\n    if (props.in) {\n      if (appear) {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n        _this.appearStatus = ENTERING;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = ENTERED;\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (props.unmountOnExit || props.mountOnEnter) {\n        initialStatus = UNMOUNTED;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n      }\n    }\n\n    _this.state = {\n      status: initialStatus\n    };\n    _this.nextCallback = null;\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  Transition.getDerivedStateFromProps = function getDerivedStateFromProps(_ref, prevState) {\n    var nextIn = _ref.in;\n\n    if (nextIn && prevState.status === UNMOUNTED) {\n      return {\n        status: EXITED\n      };\n    }\n\n    return null;\n  } // getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps) {\n  //   let nextStatus = null\n  //   if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n  //     const { status } = this.state\n  //     if (this.props.in) {\n  //       if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = ENTERING\n  //       }\n  //     } else {\n  //       if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = EXITING\n  //       }\n  //     }\n  //   }\n  //   return { nextStatus }\n  // }\n  ;\n\n  var _proto = Transition.prototype;\n\n  _proto.componentDidMount = function componentDidMount() {\n    this.updateStatus(true, this.appearStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentDidUpdate = function componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    var nextStatus = null;\n\n    if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n      var status = this.state.status;\n\n      if (this.props.in) {\n        if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = ENTERING;\n        }\n      } else {\n        if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = EXITING;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    this.updateStatus(false, nextStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentWillUnmount = function componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.cancelNextCallback();\n  };\n\n  _proto.getTimeouts = function getTimeouts() {\n    var timeout = this.props.timeout;\n    var exit, enter, appear;\n    exit = enter = appear = timeout;\n\n    if (timeout != null && typeof timeout !== 'number') {\n      exit = timeout.exit;\n      enter = timeout.enter; // TODO: remove fallback for next major\n\n      appear = timeout.appear !== undefined ? timeout.appear : enter;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      exit: exit,\n      enter: enter,\n      appear: appear\n    };\n  };\n\n  _proto.updateStatus = function updateStatus(mounting, nextStatus) {\n    if (mounting === void 0) {\n      mounting = false;\n    }\n\n    if (nextStatus !== null) {\n      // nextStatus will always be ENTERING or EXITING.\n      this.cancelNextCallback();\n\n      if (nextStatus === ENTERING) {\n        this.performEnter(mounting);\n      } else {\n        this.performExit();\n      }\n    } else if (this.props.unmountOnExit && this.state.status === EXITED) {\n      this.setState({\n        status: UNMOUNTED\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  _proto.performEnter = function performEnter(mounting) {\n    var _this2 = this;\n\n    var enter = this.props.enter;\n    var appearing = this.context ? this.context.isMounting : mounting;\n\n    var _ref2 = this.props.nodeRef ?
